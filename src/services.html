              An endless stream of contracts, tax issues, labor relations,
              corporate papers - legal work distracts you from doing business.
              But there is not much work to do to hire an in-house lawyer. In
              addition, over time, the work will become the same type and
              uninteresting for a full-time lawyer. And we know very well how
              difficult it is to find a good candidate with experience in the
              field of information technology in Ukraine.
